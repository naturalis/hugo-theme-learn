# Hugo Learn Theme

This repository contains a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), based on great [Grav Learn Theme](http://learn.getgrav.org/).

Visit the [theme documentation](https://learn.netlify.com/en/) to see what is going on. It is actually built with this theme.

## Main features

- Automatic Search
- Multilingual mode
- Unlimited menu levels
- Automatic next/prev buttons to navigate through menu entries
- Image resizing, shadowâ€¦
- Attachments files
- List child pages
- Mermaid diagram (flowchart, sequence, gantt)
- Customizable look and feel and themes variants
- Buttons, Tip/Note/Info/Warning boxes, Expand

## Extra Features for Naturalis

Taxonomies now are also automatically added to the navigation. This is done by
[extra code in the menu partial](https://github.com/naturalis/hugo-theme-naturalis/blob/df79612d9a5496265db7469113a0a7cdacabc40f/layouts/partials/menu.html#L28).

These are also added to the [json generated for search](https://github.com/naturalis/hugo-theme-naturalis/blob/df79612d9a5496265db7469113a0a7cdacabc40f/layouts/index.json#L13).

The breadcrumb for taxonomies is [also generated differently](https://github.com/naturalis/hugo-theme-naturalis/blob/df79612d9a5496265db7469113a0a7cdacabc40f/layouts/partials/header.html#L93).

These taxonomy pages can not use the next/prev buttons, so for taxonomy and terms they
[are no longer displayed](https://github.com/naturalis/hugo-theme-naturalis/blob/df79612d9a5496265db7469113a0a7cdacabc40f/layouts/partials/footer.html#L12).
